Jekyll runs on Ruby, and even though I had some experience with Ruby at work, customizing themes was tough, and none of the available themes really appealed to me.</p><p>Later, I discovered there were many other SSGs and decided to try Hexo since it&#39;s JavaScript-based, and the theme was using Jade/Pug which I liked, thinking it would be easier to work with. But I ran into similar issues â€” specifically with integrating my old portfolio, handling routing, and keeping it updated â€” so it didn&#39;t work out as well as I had hoped. Looking back, I was probably trying to add too many things to it.</p><p>Now I&#39;m using VitePress (I guess this is V3), and so far, it seems to be the best option. Updating and migrating to newer versions has been smooth, the setup is simple, and I really appreciate the effort the theme author put into it. ðŸ™Œ - I don&#39;t remember how I stumbled upon it.</p><p>And look at that â€” I just found Google Analytics set up in my old site&#39;s code, which I had completely forgotten about. I should check it out later.</p><p>P.S.
